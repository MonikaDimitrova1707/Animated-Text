# Animated-Text
A vanilla JavaScript script that captures the visible text content of a webpage and then
replaces the entire webpage content with a white canvas displaying the captured text sentence
by sentence like a movie by paying attention to the time needed for every sentence to be read
properly from the observer (long sentences are displayed for a longer period than short
sentences).
